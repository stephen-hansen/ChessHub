Static Analysis Documentation:

For static analysis we are using eslint with the airbnb-base style guide along
with extensions to support common React.js and Jest functionality. You
may run the static analysis by downloading the required packages (`npm
install`) and then running `npx eslint backend/ src/` to run static analysis
on all project files. 

The static analysis output is below. Note that serviceWorker.js is a file
generated and required by React.js, hence the error and warnings. Otherwise,
all of our hand-written code has no warnings and errors when run through
the static analyzer (note that eslint does not show files with no errors and
no warnings).
